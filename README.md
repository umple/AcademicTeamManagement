# Academic Team Management

The `Academic Team Management` application is used to automate many of the facilities of managing a large class of multi-person groups.  Currently, it is being used by the SEG4910/4911 Software Engineering Capstone Course at the University of Ottawa. By automating essential processes, the system enhances collaboration and efficiency for `students`, `professors`, `TAs`, and `external clients`.

This project is open-source.
