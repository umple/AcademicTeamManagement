# Objectives:

### Overview
- Create a project management system for courses that have projects as a main component.
### Benefit to Customer
- Better management and organization of the groups/projects
- Allow course coordinators to determine students that do not have a team to work with or a project to work on.
- Allow students to view available project and teams to join more easily.
- Flexible and dynamic system that can work for more than one course.
### Criteria For Success:
- Continous meeting with Dr. Lethbride to go over progress.
- Dedicating time each week to plan, design, implement, and communicate work on the project.
- Follow the Agile Methodology for more successful project management.

# Expected Architecture:

It will most likely be a client-server architecture - technologies will be documented here when a decision has been reached.

# Anticipated Risks

1) Scope Creep:
    - The project can be built to include lots of feature, so we must ensure that we select the most important features for SEG 4910.
    - Continous discussions with Dr. Lethbridge to determine if a specific feature is important at this particular stage or not.

# Legal and Social Issues:

- None anticipated at this point.

# Initial Plans:

- To be updated in the coming weeks.
