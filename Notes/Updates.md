# Updates about what we are doing and concerns we may have

## 01/16/2023
### Update:
- During our first meeting, we worked on the design of application using UMPLE. Link here: https://cruise.umple.org/umpleonline/umple.php?model=230113sak5joa7booi . We used the 4 classes as discussed in our previous meeting. We planned into having a general user class, which is an abstraction for Professor and Student. We also have the metadata class which will hold any extra data that can be manually added for the other classes. 
- We have started updating the README.md file of the AcademicTeamManagement repo 
- We created a Miro Board that has the design alternatives of the technologies that we might use. Link: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPyQl_eM=/ . Based on our votes, we agreed on using: Javascript+ReactJs, Python+Flask, MongoDB  
### Concerns:
- What is the difference between Professor and Coordinator? And should we have both in our system? 
- **Answer (01/19/2023):** There may not be a difference between coordinator and professor.
