## Retrospective
### What went well
- Each week we implemented the task that needed to be done
- Efficient communication
- Respect for other team members and consideration of their time

### What could have been improved
- Start working on tasks as soon as possible (i.e., could have completed more tasks from the start)
- Start testing sooner. We would have added more tests and maybe find more issues.
