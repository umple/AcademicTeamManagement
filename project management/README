## Project Description (what software are you building upon)
The Academic Team Management application is used to automate many of the facilities of managing a large class of multi-person groups and supports the following use cases:

Creating lists of projects with a title, description, and other metadata
Importing lists of students from Excel
Enabling students to form teams, express interest in projects, express an interest in being matched with other students, etc...
Allowing the professor and TAs to communicate with students using chat
Allowing the professor and TAs to take notes about progress, presentations, etc...
Exporting the data to Excel sheets
Allowing the professor or TAs to input grades
The application is expected to be open-source and allow other professors from different educational institutions to adapt it as their project management system.

## Other tools (e.g. Basecamp, Trello, etc)
